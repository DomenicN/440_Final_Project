# 440_Final_Project

## Code:
Code is split between the main python file main.py which was used to generate all of the figures and a Jupiter notebook which contains the code for the correlation analysis. 

## Data:
Data is available from gene expression omnibus at the following accession IDs: GSE134732, GSE122662, and GSE112004. Data should be downloaded and placed in the Data folder for the code to run properly without modifications.

## Figures:
Final figures are included in the Figures folder. Not all figures were used in the final report.

## GSEA:
GSEA results are included in the GSEA folder for convenience.
